Hi, my name is Arthur. I am an avid learner and software developer. I am fascinated by all(most) things revolutionary in tech. I am passionate about leveraging technology to make our lives more full of the things we love. I am a Computer Science student at the Technical University of Munich, Germany and build cool applications on the side.

This site is where I ramble about all things that interest me and that seem worth writing about during my journey to becoming a modern software ninja in an ever changing world. I am sharing this to map this journey for myself and everyone who is interested and hopefully spread my love for creating cool things.

Currently I am intensively diving into the fascinating world of Javscript, which seems to be a great tool for making the applications I love.

I hope you enjoy my site and definitely hit me up at arthur.mathies@googlemail.com if you have questions or comments about anything on my site. 

Also check out my <a href="/projects">Projects</a> and my LinkedIn or [Github](https://github.com/arthurmathies) if you are interested.
