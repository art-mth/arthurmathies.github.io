##aMaze

![](/assets/aMazeExample.png)
**aMaze** is a simple maze game harnessing the power of [**lanterna**](https://code.google.com/p/lanterna/). **Lanterna** is a neat console text GUI library for Java( even though an old school one). **aMaze** itself is an ASCII terminal-based application, in which players try to evade dangerous monsters that try to devour them on their way out of the labyrinth. On their way out players have to find the magic key, which is their only way out of the hellish terminal maze.
