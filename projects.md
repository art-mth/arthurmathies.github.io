##Challengr
![](/assets/challengr/exampleView.png)
**Challengr** is a social challenging app where you can challenge friends to complete the tasks that are long overdue and help them achieve their goals. 

The special thing about **Challengr** is the incentive system. Every time you challenge a friend you put a donation (normally a small amount) to a charity that you choose on the line. If the challenged completes the challenge the money goes to the charity. If he does not though the money goes back to the challenger and the charity misses out. The newsfeed puts the completed as well as non completed challenges into the spotlight. Everyone can see that you missed to complete the challenge and that the money did not go to charity. The approach is backed by the famous self-determination theory and makes it much easier for your friends to complete important milestones in their lifes.

##knapsack

**knapsack** is a web application that connects readers. With the ability to share booktitles and personally curated collections of booktitles **knapsack** makes it easier than ever to share your book recommendations with the community. Hooked up Book API's make it easy to find the books you are looking for and adding them to the collection you choose even easier. 

Driven by the dream that you do not have to use your notes app to write down the books you liked or want to read anymore, because you would not find them later anyway, everything is tightly integrated into the app. Our database and simple design make sure you can find exactly the ones you are looking for at any time. Also no need to use antiquated emails to share your books. Just choose who you want to share the collection or specific book with and it automagically gets added as a recommendation for the specified user and he or she can see it in his or her account.

##aMaze

**aMaze** is a simple maze game harnessing the power of [**lanterna**](https://code.google.com/p/lanterna/). **Lanterna** is a neat console text GUI library for Java(even though an old school one). **aMaze** itself is an ASCII terminal-based application, in which players try to evade dangerous monsters that try to devour them on their way out of the labyrinth. On their way out players have to find the magic key, which is their only way out of the hellish terminal maze.
