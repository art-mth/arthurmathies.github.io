##aMaze

![](/assets/aMaze/aMazeExample.png)
**aMaze** is a simple maze game harnessing the power of [**lanterna**](https://code.google.com/p/lanterna/). **Lanterna** is a neat console text GUI library for Java( even though an old school one ). **aMaze** itself is an ASCII terminal-based application, in which players try to evade dangerous monsters that try to devour them on their way out of the labyrinth. On their way out players have to find the magic key, which is their only way out of the hellish terminal maze.

Check it out [here](/projects/aMaze) or on [Github](https://github.com/arthurmathies/aMaze).

##knapsack

**knapsack** is a web application that connects readers. With the ability to share booktitles and personally curated collections of booktitles **knapsack** makes it easier than ever to share your book recommendations with the community. Hooked up Book API's make it easy to find the books you are looking for and adding them to the collection you choose even easier. 

Driven by the dream that you do not have to use your notes app to write down the books you liked or want to read anymore, because you would not find them later anyway, everything is tightly integrated into the app. Our database and simple design make sure you can find exactly the ones you are looking for at any time. Also no need to use antiquated emails to share your books. Just choose who you want to share the collection or specific book with and it automagically gets added as a recommendation for the specified user and he or she can see it in his or her account.

Check out the application here: [https://knapsack-app.herokuapp.com](https://knapsack-app.herokuapp.com/#/landing) or check it out on [Github](https://github.com/knapsack-app/knapsack)
