On **Gameplan** you can find sport sites close by to meet up with friends and or strangers for a good game of Baseball, Basketball, Soccer or whatever else sparks your interest. The Geolocation based app makes it easy to find courts and check if anyone is checked in (currently playing) on those courts. Also you can reserve courts with our reservation system, invite friends and get the specifics for your reservation via email.
